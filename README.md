## Description

Dio HTTP mock adapter for Dart/Flutter (compatible with Mockito).

Sometimes, testing classes which are dependent on [Dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) requests are really tricky and require lots of boilerplate, this is where [http_mock_adapter](https://pub.dev/packages/http_mock_adapter) comes in, to make `Dio` request testing more flexible than it has ever been.

By simply defining requests with their methods and responses by using chains of our [DioAdapter](https://pub.dev/documentation/http_mock_adapter/latest/http_mock_adapter/DioAdapter-class.html) and replacing `Dio`'s [httpClientAdapter](https://pub.dev/documentation/dio/latest/dio/HttpClientAdapter-class.html) with your custom mocked adapter, you will be able to mock basically any request that `Dio` can support.

Moreover, `http_mock_adapter` package supports request mocking with interceptors which are created via DioInterceptor class, so instead of replacing `Dio`'s `httpClientAdapter`, you can add your mocked interceptor inside the [dio.interceptors](https://pub.dev/documentation/dio/latest/dio/Interceptors-class.html) list by using its [add](https://api.dart.dev/dev/2.12.0-29.0.dev/dart-collection/ListMixin/add.html) method.

You can find example in [examples](https://pub.dev/packages/http_mock_adapter/example) section of `http_mock_adapter` package.

## Usage

Here is the basic usage scenario of the package (via `DioAdapter`):

```dart
import 'package:dio/dio.dart';
import 'package:http_mock_adapter/http_mock_adapter.dart';

void main() async {
  final dio = Dio();
  final dioAdapter = DioAdapter();

  dio.httpClientAdapter = dioAdapter;

  const path = 'https://example.com';

  dioAdapter
      .onGet(path) // `path` can be either `String` or `RegExp`
      .reply(200, {'message': 'Successfully mocked GET!'})
      .onPost(path)
      .reply(200, {'message': 'Successfully mocked POST!'});

  final onGetResponse = await dio.get(path);
  print(onGetResponse.data); // {message: Successfully mocked GET!}

  final onPostResponse = await dio.post(path);
  print(onPostResponse.data); // {message: Successfully mocked POST!}
}
```
